<hr>
<p> Children's Day is celebrated in India to raise awareness about the rights, education, and welfare of children. It is celebrated on 14 November every year in honour of the birthday of the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was known to have been fond of children. On this day, many educational and motivational programs for children are held all over India. Some schools in India observe Children's Day as a holiday for their students, while private schools often organise a fair for their students.</p>
